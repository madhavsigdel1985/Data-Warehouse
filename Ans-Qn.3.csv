7,"numerical solution of shock and ramp compression for general material properties","http://arxiv.org/abs/0704.0008","a general formulation was developed to represent material models for applications in dynamic loading. numerical methods were devised to calculate response to shock and ramp compression, and ramp decompression, generalizing previous solutions for scalar equations of state. the numerical methods were found to be flexible and robust, and matched analytic results to a high accuracy. the basic ramp and shock solution methods were coupled to solve for composite deformation paths, such as shock-induced impacts, and shock interactions with a planar interface between different materials. these calculations capture much of the physics of typical material dynamics experiments, without requiring spatially-resolving simulations. example calculations were made of loading histories in metals, illustrating the effects of plastic work on the temperatures induced in quasi-isentropic and shock-release experiments, and the effect of a phase transition.","mathematics","damian c. swift","2007-03-31"
87,"a general approach to statistical modeling of physical laws: nonparametric regression","http://arxiv.org/abs/0704.0089","statistical modeling of experimental physical laws is based on the probability density function of measured variables. it is expressed by experimental data via a kernel estimator. the kernel is determined objectively by the scattering of data during calibration of experimental setup. a physical law, which relates measured variables, is optimally extracted from experimental data by the conditional average estimator. it is derived directly from the kernel estimator and corresponds to a general nonparametric regression. the proposed method is demonstrated by the modeling of a return map of noisy chaotic data. in this example, the nonparametric regression is used to predict a future value of chaotic time series from the present one. the mean predictor error is used in the definition of predictor quality, while the redundancy is expressed by the mean square distance between data points. both statistics are used in a new definition of predictor cost function. from the minimum of the predictor cost function, a proper number of data in the model is estimated.","physics","i. grabec","2007-04-01"
